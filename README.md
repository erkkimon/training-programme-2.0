personal-travis-beta
====================

Personal Travis aka. Personal Raineri is an application to substitute your personal trainer, training diary and workout programme.

Personal Travis suggests the user a workout routine and weights. Personal Travis remembers the last suggestion, and will suggest the following workout routine based on former routines. Personal Travis also remembers, if the user has reached the goal set by Personal Travis.

All goals will be the same until the user reaches them. Then Personal Travis will suggest a higher goal, so all user needs to do is to (1) see what to do this time and (2) tick a checkbox if a goal is reached. Everything else happens automagically.

Naming policy
=============

All the files, folders, CSS/HTML classes and ID:s will be named lowercase, with dashes as spaces. JavaScript-related names are an exception, and JavaScript object, function and variable names are written in lowercase with medial capitals.
